## üíª How to run

---

First of all certify that you have Node.js 9.3.0 version installed.

I recomend to use nvm to manage between node versions.

You may have the mongo DB version 3.6.2 to be compactible with the current mongoose.

I recommend to use a docker container to be more easy envoiremnt setup.

You can run the following command:

```
docker run --name mongodbOld -p 27017:27017 -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=codedemobr -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=123abc mongo:3.6.2

```

Be smart. You can change the passaword, container name and others configs. So you need to change the user permitions in the collection:

```
db.createUser(
{
   user: "codedemonbr",
   pwd: "123abc",
   roles: [
     { role: "readWrite", db: "DATABASE NAME" }
   ]
})

```

1. Run `npm install`;
2. Run in two instances of terminal `npm run compile` and `npm run runDev`;
3. Test API routes using [Insomnia][insomnia] or [Postman][postman] or [Chromium][chromium] Browser

## üõ£ Routes

---

**In insomnia you will have files to import and test the api.**
Select one to have access to the routes.
You can run `npm run test` to run the tests.

## üóÑÔ∏è How to access MongoDB database

---

You will need to have MongoDB installed. Start mongod:

```
 mongod --dbpath=../path/to/mongoData/db
```

Certainly you need to know where is your mongo data path to replace.
